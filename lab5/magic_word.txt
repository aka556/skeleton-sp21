ArrayDeque Feedback:

1. Good job utilizing a circular array with two pointers for efficiency. However, consider ways to reduce memory usage and avoid unnecessary complexity.
2. Be mindful of function naming and documentation—clear names and explanations will make your code easier to maintain.
3. Testing is not just about fixing bugs but also about improving code design. Try to leverage well-structured test cases earlier in development.
4. Iteration is key—seek more elegant solutions rather than just functional ones.

LinkedListDeque Feedback:

1. Implementing a doubly linked list was a strong choice. However, using a sentinel node could have simplified boundary cases.
2. Be cautious with pointer manipulations—they can be error-prone. Strive for clean, structured updates to prevent null references.
3. Consider writing more test cases upfront to catch edge cases early and improve code robustness.
4 .Aim for code elegance—efficiency is important, but clarity and maintainability matter just as much.

Keep refining your approach, and great work so far!
